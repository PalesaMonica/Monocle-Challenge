# Monocle-Challenge

## **Problem Overview**

Financial literacy, the ability to understand principles and calculations
related to inflation, interest and specifically compound interest, could be
as low as 50% across South Africans.

While research is sparce, a 2020 study found that only 28% of South African respondents correctly
answered questions relating to compound interest and most did not understand how compound
interest increased money saved over time.

Alternatively, compound interest mixed with debt can have a debilitating impact on everyday South
Africans, particularly in light of our countryâ€™s overindebtedness and sky-high interest rates offered to
underprivileged people.

### **Objective**:

- The aim is to understand the financial literacy of South African and what factors cause low financial literacy
